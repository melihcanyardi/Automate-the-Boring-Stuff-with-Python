# Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python
This repository includes the Python scripts I have written for both **exercises** and **practice projects** of the *first part* of ***Automate the Boring Stuff with Python***.

Note that although the files are not ordered properly, they have been given the names that was suggested by the book at relevant pages. Therefore, I believe it will be helpful for those who are specifically looking for a certain script.
